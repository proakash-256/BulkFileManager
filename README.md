# Bulk File Manager

This project uses the os module of Python Standard Library to manage bulk files and folders.  
It offers two functionalities:
- Create Bulk Folders
- Rename Bulk Files and Folders  

### Special Features:
- It automatically gets the extension of a file so that the type of the file does not change, while renaming in bulk.
- It takes start value as input, from where we would want to start creating or renaming the files. It's default value is 1.
